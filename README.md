# dr.ConsolePad
Inspired by LINQPad, this is a PoC ( hack ;) ) of bringing LINQPad's famous `.Dump()` extension method to the console.

The ambition is to make a library that makes script-like prototyping in C# a breeze by being able to easily display nicely formatted results. 
With C#9 allowing top-level statements, writing scripts and prototypes for the console in C# has become more and more feasible.

Future idea include a `.ToCsv` method and other data visualization or data serializing extension methods for the console.

## Current state
This is by no means complete, robust, or perhaps not even working. Use at own risk. This was hacked together in an evening as a proof-of-concept for an internal presentation at my workplace. I might improve it in the future if I feel like it ;)
